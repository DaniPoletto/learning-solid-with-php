# Learning SOLID With PHP

## How is the project?
This project was created during the course of Alura to study the principles of SOLID with PHP. The objective is to refactor an existing project using these principles.

## What are SOLID principles?
SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They are:
 
1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open / Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Every class/method <b>SHOULD</b> have <b>only</b> one reason to change. 

### 2. Open / Closed Principle
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) <b>SHOULD</b> be <b>open</b> for extension, but <b>closed</b> for modification.

### 3. Liskov Segregation Principle
Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes. Child classes must never violate the type definitions of the parent class.

## Project installation
